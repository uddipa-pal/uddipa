# Hi! I'm Uddipa. :)
I am currently in my senior year, living in Kolkata, India. This is about my journey. Enjoy! 

## My Horcruxes 

  - ### Mathematics - Maths comes very naturally to me. I kinda live for the moment when a problem makes sense- that adrenaline rush is everything. I often juggle the traditional JEE maths with proof based side of Maths, depending on my mood. Never will I, not be surprised by how we can understand the Universe through the lenses of Mathematics.
  - ### Physics - Same about Physics! My JEE aspirant self can never think of Physics without Maths and vice versa, even though most of my friends don't like Physics cause that is Soft Science!? 
  - ### Dance - I am a classical dancer. I have been learning Odissi since I was 2.5 years old. Safe to say, I opt for dancing whenever the real world becomes too much stressful. I love to dance to Bollywood songs(they have very questionable lyrics though), and K-pop songs( they have lyrics which I do not understand) apart from classical.
  - ### Chess - I am not a pro at it but obviously, I love to play Chess. :))
  - ### Movies - I love watching movies. Growing up, I even wanted to become an actress. Thankfully, I do not have that desire alive by now. Feel free to suggest me movies though.
  - ### Reading - I love to read. I am not able to feel emotions on my own, most of the time. (Hence I call myself Voldemort) So reading different stories always helps me feel emotions through other's points of view.
  - ### Teaching - I have been often told that I am quite good at explaining things But, while describing, I mix so many things together that I get distracted from the original topic. But, again I love to teach.
